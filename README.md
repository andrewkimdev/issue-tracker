# Angular + Clarity Design (by VMWare) Example
This code is a hands-on-lab exercise work done along with [Angular Projects Second Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Angular-Projects-exploring-cutting-edge-technologies-ebook/dp/B08XXNBKNP), Chapter 2.
- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.2.
- [Clarity Design System](https://clarity.design/) version 15.12.1

## Notes
- This should work well as a boilerplate to use Angular + Clarity Design System.

## Deviation from Text
- Angular 12 -> 16

## TODO (If I care to do so...)
- Link with backend
- Add user login
- Add file attachment
- Add issue tracking analytics - issue generation vs. resolution velocity, histogram, etc.
- Add user group, organization
- Add priority
- Add comments
- Add tags for task
- Add alerting scheme for user
